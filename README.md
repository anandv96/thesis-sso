# OAuth 2.0 Protocol Formal Verification

This repository contains the analysis and verification work on the OAuth 2.0 protocol. Two formal verification tools, PSPSP (Performing Security Proofs of Stateful Protocols), a theory in Isabelle/HOL, and OFMC (Open-Source Fixedpoint Model-Checker) were been used to perform this study. These files constitute our effort to understand and analyze the formal properties of the OAuth 2.0 protocol.

## Tools 

1. **PSPSP:** You can download the PSPSP tool from the [website of the authors](https://www.imm.dtu.dk/~samo/pspsp.html).

2. **OFMC:** You can download the OFMC tool from the [website of the authors](https://www.imm.dtu.dk/~samo/).
